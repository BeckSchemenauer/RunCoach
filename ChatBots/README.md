This folder contains models to tailor the coach's output right before it is sent.

BART_based:
Contains two BART based models, a sentence polisher and a sentence expander. The sentence polisher is used as a last step before the coach outputs an answer. The sentence expander is a WIP for more diverse outputs from the coach.

Llama_based:
A rough attempt to create natural language based on a simple prompt, too unpredictable, opted for BART instead.

T5_based:
Attempted this before BART just to see if I could get it to work. It spoke in german instead, does not work.
